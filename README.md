## About

### Freelanceâ€‹

I create and manage custom Drupal, HTML/CSS, and WordPress sites.

I am comfortable configuring, maintaining, and using the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack. I work with hosting sites like Bluehost, Hostinger, Rackspace, and more to host the sites.

### Full-time

#### Currently

* I work for [CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/) as an Associate Director of Drupal.â€‹
* I serve as backend developer working with remote Agile teams of Drupal experts to build enterprise-level websites for client organizations.
* I worked on the Defense Security Cooperation Agencyâ€™s GlobalNET platform project. I created Drupal and ILIAS solutions and tests that make up the platform. I also worked with the DevSecOps engineers to improve our continuous integration that runs on Docker and GitLab and help troubleshoot site issues in AWS. I also contributed back solutions to the Drupal and ILIAS communities.
* I worked on the General Services Administrationâ€™s (GSA) OpenACR project. OpenACR is a digital native Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR) product. I create validator, editor tools with tests in JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, and Svelte. I use GitHub to manage the source, run the tests in GitHub actions and deploy the editor to GitHub pages.
* I contribute to the CivicActions accessibility practice area. Work with co-workers on improving how accessibility testing is included in our projects and community. I set up automated testing on the practice areaâ€™s website using pa11y, Cypress, Axe, and GitHub action. I shared the solutions with colleagues outside of CivicActions like the General Services Administrationâ€™s 18F team. I recently published a post on [automated accessibility testing to Opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/23/2/automated-accessibility-testing).

#### Previously

* I worked for the University of Oregon as a [Senior Developer for Information Services](https://is.uoregon.edu/).
* I worked on a Scrum team with 3 developers, 2 designers, and a product owner to develop and deploy web-based sites. [I was the scrum master and I helped coach team members on scrum practices](https://news.uoregon.edu/content/inspiring-teamwork-behind-adopting-new-technology).
* I worked on an Angular + .NET solution that was deployed with continuous integration + deployment to Azure. In Azure, I helped set up and use multiple app services, functions, application insights, storage accounts, Graph API, Azure DevOps, and MySQL service.
* I created customized install profiles, modules, and other Drupal features to meet the clientâ€™s requirements.
* I was an active member of the UO Drupal committee.
* I worked with system administrators to create Docker solutions for developers to run WordPress, Drupal, and other applications in Mac, Windows, and Linux environments. This included a Docker Swarm setup to host our legacy sites.
