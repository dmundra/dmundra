## About

### Freelance​

I create and manage custom Drupal, HTML/CSS, and WordPress sites.

I am comfortable configuring, maintaining, and using the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack. I work with hosting sites like Bluehost, Hostinger, Rackspace, and more to host the sites.

### Full-time

#### Currently

I work for [CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/) as an Associate Director of Drupal.​

As associate director:
* I support and mentor 7 direct reports on their projects, technical leadership opportunities, professional development, their related objectives and key results. I help them resolve conflicts and coach them on leading and supporting their team members on their work and contributing back.
* I participate in program, practice areas, and policy discussions and implementation. I helped review the COVID-19 vaccine policy and affirmative action policy. I brought together coworkers, worked on, and updated the handbook with an updated tech lead role description, the CivicActions Accessibility champions program, video call best practices, difficult conversation guide, Drupal practice area onboarding documentation, and manager support best practices. I also participate in leadership training. For example I helped lead an OKR activity at a leadership summit, I do role playing exercises with new managers, and I lead a conversation training exercise for all managers.
* I participate in hiring by conducting interviews and reviewing take home submissions. I have also helped improve our take home exercise to have more automated tests and updated descriptions to assist the applicants. I also serve as hiring manager for web accessibility engineer hires where I have handled communications, worked with subject matters experts to create and update the questions, work with hiring lead to schedule interviews and help pick the best candidate. I also help retrospect on our hiring process and work on improving them. For example after internal hire missteps, I interviewed the internal candidate to get their feedback and use that to define areas of improvements like communication and handling project implications.
* I support other teams on agile practices. I helped review the team working for the National Science Foundation on their implementation of the LESS framework and how they try to be agile with that framework.

As an engineer:
* I work on scrum teams with developers, DevSecOps engineers, QA engineers, project manager, and product owner. I serve as a backend, DevOps, and lead engineer working primarily on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/u/dmundra) to build enterprise-level websites for client organizations.
* I am DevOps lead for the National Science Foundation main site and I work with a team to support Jenkins and AWS infrastructure. I ensure the developers have stable Jenkins jobs for their code changes and are getting timely feedback for their work.
* I supported multiple Drupal data sites for Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services by doing code reviews and writing tests for the open source DKAN project that powers the sites.
* I worked on the Defense Security Cooperation Agency’s GlobalNET platform project. I created Drupal and ILIAS solutions and tests that make up the platform. I also worked with the DevSecOps engineers to improve our continuous integration that runs on Docker and GitLab and help troubleshoot site issues in AWS. I also contributed back solutions to the Drupal and ILIAS communities.
* I worked on the General Services Administration’s (GSA) OpenACR project. OpenACR is a digital native Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR) product. I create validator, editor tools with tests in JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, and Svelte. I use GitHub to manage the source, run the tests in GitHub actions and deploy the editor to GitHub pages.
* I contribute to the CivicActions accessibility practice area. Work with co-workers on improving how accessibility testing is included in our projects and community. I set up automated testing on the practice area’s website using pa11y, Cypress, Axe, and GitHub action. I shared the solutions with colleagues outside of CivicActions like the General Services Administration’s 18F team. I recently published a post on [automated accessibility testing to Opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/23/2/automated-accessibility-testing).

#### Previously

* I worked for the University of Oregon as a [Senior Developer for Information Services](https://is.uoregon.edu/).
* I worked on a Scrum team with 3 developers, 2 designers, and a product owner to develop and deploy web-based sites. [I was the scrum master and I helped coach team members on scrum practices](https://news.uoregon.edu/content/inspiring-teamwork-behind-adopting-new-technology).
* I worked on an Angular + .NET solution that was deployed with continuous integration + deployment to Azure. In Azure, I helped set up and use multiple app services, functions, application insights, storage accounts, Graph API, Azure DevOps, and MySQL service.
* I created customized install profiles, modules, and other Drupal features to meet the client’s requirements.
* I was an active member of the UO Drupal committee.
* I worked with system administrators to create Docker solutions for developers to run WordPress, Drupal, and other applications in Mac, Windows, and Linux environments. This included a Docker Swarm setup to host our legacy sites.
